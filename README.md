# Classification Grading of Nam Dok Mai See-Thong Mango by Deep Learning and Transfer Learning
 This GitHub repository hosts the code and resources for a project that applies deep learning and transfer learning techniques to classify and grade Nam Dok Mai See-Thong mangoes.

instruction:
IMGcropresize.ipynb
    The Python script titled "IMGcropresize.ipynb" serves the purpose of cropping an image dataset and subsequently resizing it for utilization within a machine learning model.
classify____.ipynb
    The Python script "classifymold.ipynb" is intended for the training and testing of a model to classify the presence of mold. This is done to evaluate and monitor the associated metrics.
DataSet.zip
    DataSet.zip is a compressed file that contains an image dataset of mangoes, organized into separate folders for each classification test.
